# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that focuses on understanding the underlying structure and patterns of a dataset. EDA helps to identify trends, relationships, anomalies, or any initial insights that could inform the next steps in a data science or machine learning project.

 Conducted EDA on a employees dataset with 1000 rows and 8 cloumns,columns like First Name, Gender, Start Date, Last Login Time, Salary, Bonus %, Senior Management, Team.

### Tools & Libraries used
> Programming Language: Python

> Libraries: Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn

### Steps in EDA include
> Understanding the data size,column name,cloumn data types & summary statistics, checked for missing data fixed it by filling or removing with average imputation or by droping.

> Checked the relation between variables how they are coorelated with each other by using pairplot, analysed individual columns to understand distributions.

> Carried out outlier detection steps to make the dataset free from the outliers by using the boxplot to identify outlier and removing them by using statistical ways.

> Created Visualizations to better understand data such as bar chart, boxplot, histograms, kdeplot like how is the data distributed.

### Purpose of EDA
We carry EDA to prepare the data for fitting ML algorithms.

Without EDA, analysis or modeling may fail due to poor data quality, unexamined assumptions, or overlooked insights, to avoid with such errors we perform EDA.
